Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":{"assets":["<table>", "<shelf_left>", "<shelf_right>"],
    "asset_states": {"<shelf_left>": "on_something(<table>)",
                    "<shelf_right>": "on_something(<table>)"},
    "objects": ["<cylinder>"],
    "object_states": {"<cylinder>": "on_something(<table>)"}}}
"""
Asset states and object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- inside_something(<something>): Object is located inside <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
- closed(): Object can be opened
- open(): Object can be closed or kept opened
"""
<something> should be one of the assets or objects in the environment.
